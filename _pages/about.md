Terence D. Dores Cruz is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Center for Research in Experimental Economics and political Decision making (CREED)](https://www.creedexperiment.nl/creed/) at the Universiteit van Amsterdam (Faculty of Business and Economics). Terence currently studies ethical decision-making and the role of (social) information from humans and algorithms therein at Shaul Shalviâ€™s [Behavior Ethics Lab](https://www.behavioralethics.org/). In 2024, Terence completed his PhD in Bianca Beersma's [FORCE-OF-GOSSIP](https://vu.nl/en/about-vu/research-institutes/force-of-gossip) group, where he studied the cooperative and competitive functions of gossip. During his PhD, Terence was also the student-representative for the [Kurt Lewin Institute]( https://kurtlewininstituut.nl). Terence further holds a research master's degree from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam ([Amsterdam Cooperation Lab](https://amsterdamcooperationlab.com/)) and bachelor's degree from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. 

Terence's main research interests are human cooperation (and non-cooperation) and how cooperative behavior with humans and machines is shaped by reputation, social rewards, social punishments, recommendations, feedback, and other types of social and non-social information that humans and machines provide. Terence takes an interdisciplinary approach building on evolutionary, social, moral, and economic psychology employing interactive experiments, vignettes, surveys, experience sampling, and diary studies to answer questions about decision-making in the domain of cooperation, morality, and ethics.
